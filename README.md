Real estate market analysis.

This is a pet-project, in which I wanted to demonstrate and strengthen my knowledge.

The project involved analyzing the real estate market. As an analyst from a real estate company, the purpose was to study the market and offer the most profitable purchase.

As an analyst, I had the task of comparing real estate in different cities of Russia. Most clients wanted to buy real estate in St. Petersburg, so I compared this city with the rest cities of the country.

Before starting the main part of the analysis, data processing was done: checking for data population, data type, duplicates, etc.

Next, the real estate market in St. Petersburg, and the second most expensive city, was researched. The study included such questions as the average number of days before the sale of real estate, how many rooms are most common, room ceiling, cost per square meter.

Having studied all these questions, I, as an analyst of the real estate company was able to draw conclusions and offer clients the most profitable purchase of real estate for resale.
